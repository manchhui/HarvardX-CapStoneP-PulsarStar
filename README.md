# PulsarStar
HarvardX Professional Certificate - Final Capstone IDV Project

## Abstract / Introduction
In this **IDV project**, we used different machine learning algorithms to improve the prediction accuracy of **Pulsars** showed it to have prevalence, in favour of non pulsar stars, and that it would be hard to develop manual rules to accurately predict some of the **Pulsars**. The highest **accuracy** of **98.16%** was obtained using the **Decision Trees** algorithm while the highest **F1 Score** of **93%** was also obtained using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm.
